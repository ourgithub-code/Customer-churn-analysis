# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction 📉

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and identifies key factors influencing customer churn using a telecom dataset.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and churn patterns
- Identify features contributing to churn
- Prepare data for predictive modeling
- Derive business insights to improve retention

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

---

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rate.
- **Higher monthly charges** are strongly associated with increased churn.
- **Long-term contracts (1–2 years)** significantly improve customer retention.
- Pricing strategy and contract structure play a crucial role in churn reduction.

---

## 📈 Visual Analysis
- Churn distribution
- Monthly charges vs churn
- Contract type vs churn
- Boxplots and countplots for feature comparison

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Build churn prediction models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis
